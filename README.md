## Genomic Sequence Analysis

A simple Python bioinformatics project to analyze DNA sequences from FASTA files using Linux.

---

### What it does

* Reads DNA sequence from a FASTA file
* Calculates sequence length
* Calculates GC content
* Calculates nucleotide frequency (A, T, G, C)
* Saves results to a text file

### Tools

* Python
* FASTA
* Linux (Ubuntu)
* Git & GitHub

---

### How to run

From project root:

python3 src/main.py

Output is saved in:
results/analysis.txt
