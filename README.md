# Genomic Sequence Analysis

A simple Python-based bioinformatics project to analyze DNA sequences from FASTA files.
This project demonstrates basic bioinformatics concepts using Python in a Linux environment.


## What this project does

* Reads DNA sequence from a FASTA file
* Calculates sequence length
* Calculates GC content (%)
* Calculates nucleotide frequency (A, T, G, C)
* Saves results to a text file


## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* FASTA format
* Linux (Ubuntu)
* Git & GitHub

## Project Structure

* src → Python code
* data → FASTA input file
* results → Analysis output
  
## How to run
Run from project root:
python3 src/main.py
Results will be saved in:
results/analysis.txt

## Skills Shown

* Python for bioinformatics
* Genomic data handling
* Linux command line
* Git version control
